# Map Gen

This is my first attempt at procedural map generation! To keep things simple, I'm simply using OpenSimplex noise. Even then the results are pretty good. Much better than what I expected!

## Running

To run the map viewer, do the following:
1. Activate your virtual environment
2. Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Do `python src/main.py`
4. Explore!
